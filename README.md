# week4Project
#This project takes data from Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. A Public Domain Dataset for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones. 21th European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks, Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning, ESANN 2013. Bruges, Belgium 24-26 April 2013. 

#I used the data set that was current on 4 February 2022. The size of the file is greater than 61MB. This is larger than the GitHub 25MB limit. I have not included this version.

#The R code for this project is contained in the downloadable file run_analysis.R The code provides an easily understandable narrative for the analysis by segmenting the code in steps.

#A segment will look like this:
 #Add one to x 
 # "x<-x+1"
 #(end of segment)
 
 #The narrative by segmentation format makes the cognitive processes used by the programmer easy to understand.
 
 #This file produces two comma delimited files. Both files are in this repository.
 
 #week4data.csv This provides a table whose column names are the features concatenanted with the activity type and the experimental type. Information concerning whether this data  #was extracted during a training experiment or under the actual test conditions is preserved. 
 
 #averageFeatureSummary.csv This provides the averages of all the features.
 
 #In that I have thirty years experience as an applied physicist, I become very irritated when someone reduces any descriptive information about an experiment. I have included the two files that the ACTUAL experimentalists included with the compressed data down load.
 
 #EXPERIMENTAL_README.txt
 #Experimental_features_info.txt
