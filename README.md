# week4Project
#This project takes data from Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. A Public Domain Dataset for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones. 21th European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks, Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning, ESANN 2013. Bruges, Belgium 24-26 April 2013. 

#The R code for this project is contained in the downloadable file run_analysis.R The code provides an easily understandable narrative for the analysis by segmenting the code in steps.

#A segment will look like this:
 #Add one to x     <----this is what is being accomplished in this segment of the narrative
 # "x<-x+1"
 #(end of segment)
